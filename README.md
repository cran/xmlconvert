## What *xmlconvert* does

The `xmlconvert` package is made to easily and comfortably convert XML
data to R dataframes and the other way around. It provides a lot of
options to control the conversion process and to export the results to
CSV or Excel files, if desired.

## How you install *xmlconvert*

Just execute `install.packages("xmlconvert", dependencies = TRUE)` in
the R console to install the package including all packages it depends
on. By default, the `xlsx` package for writing Excel files is not
installed together with `xmlconvert`. `xmlconvert` will tell you when
you need `xlsx` and will ask you to install it then.

## How you work with *xmlconvert*

The functions `xml_to_df()` and `df_to_xml()` are the two workhorses of
the package.

The functions assume that each data record (e.g. a customer) in the XML
data is stored in one XML element/tag; the individual fields (e.g. name,
address, e-mail), however, can be represented in different ways.

An XML data file could like this:

``` xml
<datarecord>
  <field1>value1-1</field1>
  <field2>value1-2</field2>
</datarecord>

<datarecord>
  <field1>value2-1</field1>
  <field2>value2-2</field2>
</datarecord>
```

When working with the `xml_to_df()` and `df_to_xml()` functions, we
would first of all use the `records.tags` argument to provide the tag
name of the XML element that represents the records, in this example
`datarecord`. Alternatively, the `xml_to_df()`’s `records.xpath`
argument can be used to supply an XPath expression describing the
location of the data records.

In the next step, we need to specify how to find the fields. In the
example above, each field within a data record has its own XML element,
and the tag name of this element is the field name. In this case, we
would use `fields = "tags"` to make it clear to the `xmlconvert`
functions that the fields are represented by XML elements. Not always
will the tag names be the field names. The XML could also look like
this:

``` xml
<datarecord>
  <field name="field1">value1-1</field>
  <field name="field2">value1-2</field>
</datarecord>

<datarecord>
  <field name="field1">value2-1</field>
  <field name="field2">value2-2</field>
</datarecord>
```

Here, the XML elements representing the fields all have the tag `field`.
The name of the field is not given by the tag name but is an attribute
(called `name` in our case) of the `field` element. This attribute name
can be supplied to the `xmlconvert` functions using the `fields.names`
argument.

In this case, `xml_to_df()` could be called like this:
`xml_to_df("mydata.xml", records.tag = "datarecord", fields = "tags",
fields.names = "name")`

However, instead of being XML elements, the data fields could also be
represented by individual attributes, as in the following example:

``` xml
<datarecord field1="value1-1" field2="value1-2" />
<datarecord field1="value2-1" field2="value2-2" />
```

In this case, we use `fields = "attributes"` instead of `fields =
"tags"` to adjust to this XML data structure. Here, a call of
`xml_to_df()` could look like this: `xml_to_df("mydata.xml", records.tag
= "datarecord", fields="attributes"`)

The `xmlconvert` functions offer a lot of options to specify which the
data fields are to be used, how to deal with missing values, how to
treat with different data types and how to export the results. Please
consult the online help by executing `?xml_to_df` in the R console for
more information on these options.
